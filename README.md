# AWS Website Hosting

Programmatically upload a static website into AWS S3 bucket using Python SDK.

Note: I'm migrating my static website www.cross-validated.com that I host on GitHub Pages to AWS.
Because the website is being generated from templates (that AWS doesn't understand), I saved the generated version into my new GitHub
repository `aws_website_hosting` that is being downloaded and extracted in this script.
